# Mesos / Docker Integration

## Summary

Docker containers provide a consistent, compact and flexible means of packaging application builds. Delivering applications with Docker on Mesos promises a truly elastic, efficient and consistent platform for delivering a range of applications on premises or in the cloud.
This repository combines Docker with the [Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org) cluster scheduler and [Marathon](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon) but could also be used with other Mesos frameworks such as [Chronos](https://github.com/airbnb/chronos).

## Getting Started

This [tutorial](https://github.com/mesosphere/mesos-docker/blob/master/tutorial.md) shows you how you can get started with Mesos / Docker. 

## Help

If you have questions, please post on the [Marathon Framework Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/marathon-framework) email list.
You can find Mesos support in the `#mesos` channel on [freenode][freenode] (IRC).
The team at [Mesosphere](http://mesosphere.io) is also happy to answer any questions.
